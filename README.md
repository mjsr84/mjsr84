ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹HELLO!!!ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹

I am currently teaching myself to code, here's what I've been learning so far:
  1. HTML & CSS
  2. Git & GitHub
  3. JavaScript

Here is where I plan to go next:
  1. Python
  2. SQL
  3. Node.js

I will be a full-time software developer within 6 months, that is my goal and I'm dedicating long hours every single day until it's accomplished.
